/**
 * An annotation with which the usage of the command can be configured.
 * This usage can for example be displayed in an own help command.
 *
 * <p>When using the {@link ParameterParser}, the usage string has to follow a pre-defined format that is described
 * there.
 *
 * <p>When multiple {@code @Usage} annotations are used, they are combined into one {@code @Usage} annotation following
 * the pre-defined format by "OR". For example {@code @Usage("'a'") @Usage("'b'")} is the equal to
 * {@code @Usage("('a' | 'b')")}
 *
 * <p>Alternatively to using this annotation the {@link Command#getUsage()} method can be overwritten.
 * If that method is overwritten and this annotation is used, the method overwrite takes precedence.
 * That method is also what should be used to retrieve the configured usage.
