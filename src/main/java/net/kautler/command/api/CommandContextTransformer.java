/**
 * A transformer that can transform a command context in a given {@link Phase phase} or multiple ones.
 * Implementations need to be annotated with one or more {@link InPhase @InPhase} annotations to specify
 * in which phases the transformer should be called. Only one transformer per phase that can be applied
 * to a given message framework is supported currently.
 *
 * <p>Possible use-cases for example include:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         custom prefix computation for example based on the server of the message
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         fuzzy-searching for mistyped aliases and their automatic correction
 *         (this could also be used for just a "did you mean X" response,
 *         but for that the command not found events are probably better suited)
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         having a command that forwards to one command in one channel
 *         but to another command in another channel,
 *         like {@code !player} that forwards to {@code !mc:player} in an MC channel
 *         but to {@code !s4:player} in an S4 channel
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         supporting something like {@code !runas @other-user foo bar baz},
 *         where this transformer will transform that to alias {@code foo}
 *         and parameter string {@code bar baz} and then a custom {@link Restriction}
 *         can check whether the message author has the permissions to use {@code !runas}
 *         and then for example whether the {@code other-user} would have permissions
 *         for the {@code foo} command and only then allow it to proceed
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         forwarding to a {@code !help} command if an unknown command was issued
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         having a custom command registry for example with dynamically created
 *         command instances
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
