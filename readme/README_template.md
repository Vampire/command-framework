[![Supported Message Frameworks][Supported Message Frameworks Badge]](#supported-message-frameworks)

A generic CDI-based command framework. This library requires Java 8 or newer but is fully Java 9+ compatible and can run
as a proper Java module on the module path. Any arbitrary underlying message framework like a Discord library, an IRC
library, or a Skype library can be used by providing an according [`CommandHandler`][CommandHandler JavaDoc]
implementation. You are also welcome to contribute such implementations back to the main project for all users benefit.

Prerequisites
-------------
* Java 8+
* At least one of the supported [message frameworks](#supported-message-frameworks) unless an own `CommandHandler` is
  used; without one there will be no error, but this framework will simply have nothing to do
* An implementation of CDI that implements CDI $cdiVersion like [Weld SE][Weld SE Website]
* [Optional] ANTLR runtime $antlrVersion if the [`ParameterParser`][ParameterParser JavaDoc] is used



Supported Message Frameworks
----------------------------

The following message frameworks are currently supported out of the box:

* [Javacord](#javacord)
* [JDA](#jda)

If you want to have support for an additional framework, do not hesitate to open a pull request or feature request
issue.

Usage
-----

### Message Framework

#### Javacord

For the [Javacord][Javacord Website] support, include Javacord as implementation dependency and create a CDI producer
that produces either one `DiscordApi`, or if you use sharding a `Collection<DiscordApi>` with all shards where you want
commands to be handled. You should also have a disposer method that properly disconnects the produced `DiscordApi`
instances.

_**Example:**_
```java
@ApplicationScoped
public class JavacordProducer {
    @Inject
    private Logger logger;

    @Inject
    @Named
    private String discordToken;

    @Produces
    @ApplicationScoped
    private DiscordApi produceDiscordApi() {
        return new DiscordApiBuilder()
                .setToken(discordToken)
                .login()
                .whenComplete((discordApi, throwable) -> {
                    if (throwable != null) {
                        logger.error("Exception while logging in to Discord", throwable);
                    }
                })
                .join();
    }

    private void disposeDiscordApi(@Disposes DiscordApi discordApi) {
        discordApi.disconnect();
    }
}
```

$testedJavacordVersions

#### JDA

For the [JDA][JDA Website] support, include JDA as implementation dependency and create a CDI producer that produces
either one `JDA`, of if you use sharding a `Collection<JDA>`, a `ShardManager` or a `Collection<ShardManager>` with all
shards where you want commands to be handled. You should also have a disposer method that properly shuts down the
produced `JDA` and / or `ShardManager` instances.

_**Example:**_
```java
@ApplicationScoped
public class JdaProducer {
    @Inject
    private Logger logger;

    @Inject
    @Named
    private String discordToken;

    @Produces
    @ApplicationScoped
    private JDA produceJda() {
        try {
            return JDABuilder
                    .createLight(discordToken)
                    .build()
                    .awaitReady();
        } catch (InterruptedException | LoginException e) {
            logger.error("Exception while logging in to Discord", e);
            return null;
        }
    }

    private void disposeJda(@Disposes JDA jda) {
        jda.shutdown();
    }
}
```

### Creating Commands

Create a CDI bean that implements the [`Command`][Command JavaDoc] interface.

_**Example:**_
```java
@ApplicationScoped
public class PingCommand implements Command<Message> {
    @Override
    public void execute(CommandContext<? extends Message> commandContext) {
        commandContext
                .getMessage()
                .getChannel()
                .sendMessage("pong: " + commandContext.getParameterString().orElse(""))
                .exceptionally(ExceptionLogger.get());
    }
}
```

With everything else using the default, this is already enough to have a working ping bot.
A fully self-contained example can be found at `examples/simplePingBotJavacord`.

To further customize the behavior of a command, you can either annotate the command class or overwrite the
corresponding methods. Annotations are ignored when the corresponding methods are overwritten, but they can still be
separately evaluated or used as documentation. For all functionality this framework uses the command method
implementations. The annotations are only read in the default implementations of those methods.

#### Command Aliases

By overwriting the `Command#getAliases()` method or applying one or multiple [`@Alias`][@Alias JavaDoc] annotations, the
aliases to which the command reacts can be configured. If no aliases are configured, the class name, with the `Command`
or `Cmd` suffix / prefix stripped and the first letter lowercased is used as a default. If at least one alias is
configured, only the explicitly configured ones are used.

#### Asynchronous Command Execution

By overwriting the `Command#isAsynchronous()` method or applying the [`@Asynchronous`][@Asynchronous JavaDoc]
annotation, the command handler can be told to execute the command asynchronously.

How exactly this is implemented is up to the command handler that evaluates this command. Usually the command will be
executed in some thread pool. But, it would also be valid for a command handler to execute each asynchronous command
execution in a new thread, so using this can add significant overhead if overused. If a command is not doing
long-running or blocking operations, it may be preferable to not execute the command asynchronously. Although, if
long-running or blocking operations are done in the command code directly, it may be preferable to execute the command
asynchronously, as (depending on the underlying message framework) message dispatching could be blocked, introducing
serious lag to the command execution.

As the command executions are potentially done on different threads, special care must be taken, if the command holds
state, to make sure this state is accessed in a thread-safe manner. This can of course also happen without the command
being configured asynchronously if the underlying message framework dispatches message events on different threads.

#### Command Description

By overwriting the `Command#getDescription()` method or applying the [`@Description`][@Description JavaDoc] annotation,
the description of the command can be configured. This description is not currently used by this framework, but it can
be used, for example, in a custom help command.

#### Command Restrictions

By overwriting the `Command#getRestrictionChain()` method or applying one or multiple
[`@RestrictedTo`][@RestrictedTo JavaDoc] annotations, and optionally the
[`@RestrictionPolicy`][@RestrictionPolicy JavaDoc] annotation, the restriction rules for a command can be configured. If
multiple `@RestrictedTo` annotations are present and the default implementation of the method is used, a
`@RestrictionPolicy` annotation that defines how the single restrictions are to be combined is mandatory. With this
annotation the single restrictions can be combined using all-of, any-of, or none-of logic.

For more complex boolean logic either overwrite the `getRestrictionChain` method or provide custom CDI beans that
implement the [`Restriction`][Restriction JavaDoc] interface and contain the intended logic. For the latter also helpers
like [`ChannelJavacord`][ChannelJavacord JavaDoc], [`RoleJavacord`][RoleJavacord JavaDoc],
[`ServerJavacord`][ServerJavacord JavaDoc], [`UserJavacord`][UserJavacord JavaDoc], [`AllOf`][AllOf JavaDoc],
[`AnyOf`][AnyOf JavaDoc], or [`NoneOf`][NoneOf JavaDoc] can be used as super classes.

_**Examples:**_
```java
@ApplicationScoped
public class Vampire extends UserJavacord {
    private Vampire() {
        super(341505207341023233L);
    }
}
```

```java
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyFancyServer extends ServerJavacord {
    @Inject
    private MyFancyServer(@Named("myFancyServerId") long myFancyServerId) {
        super(myFancyServerId);
    }
}
```

#### Command Usage

By overwriting the `Command#getUsage()` method or applying the [`@Usage`][@Usage JavaDoc] annotation, the usage of the
command can be configured. This usage can be used, for example, in a custom help command.

When using the [`ParameterParser`][ParameterParser JavaDoc], the usage string has to follow a pre-defined format that
is described at [Parsing Parameters](#parsing-parameters).

#### Parsing Parameters

There are three helpers to split the `parameterString` that is provided to `Command#execute(...)` into multiple
parameters that can then be handled separately.

##### Simple Splitting of Parameters

The first is the method `Command.getParameters(...)` which you give the parameter string and the maximum amount of
parameters to split into. The provided string will then be split at any arbitrary amount of consecutive whitespace
characters. The last element of the returned array will have all remaining text in the parameter string. If you expect
exactly three parameters without whitespaces, you should set the max parameters to four, so you can easily test the
length of the returned array to determine if too many parameters were given to the command.

##### Semantic Parsing and Validation

The second is the [`ParameterParser`][ParameterParser JavaDoc] that you can get injected into your command. For the
`ParameterParser` to work, the [usage](#command-usage) of the command has to follow a defined syntax language. This
usage syntax is then parsed and the given parameter string analysed according to the defined syntax. If the given
parameter string does not adhere to the defined syntax, a `ParameterParseException` is thrown that can be caught and
reported to the user giving wrong arguments. The exception message is suitable to be directly forwarded to users.

The usage string has to follow this pre-defined format:
* Placeholders for free text without whitespaces (in the value) look like `<my placeholder>`
* One placeholder for free text with whitespaces (in the value) is allowed as effectively last parameter and looks like
  `<my placeholder...>`
* Literal parameters look like `'literal'`
* Optional parts are enclosed in square brackets like `[<optional placeholder>]`
* Alternatives are enclosed in parentheses and are separated by pipe characters like `('all' | 'some' | 'none')`
* Whitespace characters between the defined tokens are optional and ignored

_**Examples:**_
* `@Usage("<coin type> <amount>")`
* `@Usage("['all'] ['exact']")`
* `@Usage("[<text...>]")`
* `@Usage("(<targetLanguage> '|' | <sourceLanguage> <targetLanguage>) <text...>")`

The values for these non-typed parameters are always `String`s unless multiple parameters with the same name have a
value given by the user like with the pattern `<foo> <foo>`, in which case the value will be a `List<String>`.

_**Warning:**_ If you for example have
* an optional placeholder followed by an optional literal like in `[<placeholder>] ['literal']` or
* alternatively a placeholder or literal like in `(<placeholder> | 'literal')`

and a user invokes the command with only the parameter `literal`, it could fit in both parameter slots.
You have to decide yourself in which slot it belongs. For cases where the literal parameter can never
be meant for the placeholder, you can use `Parameters#fixup(...)` to correct the parameters instance
for the two given parameters.

##### Semantic Parsing and Validation with Type Conversions

The third is an addendum to the second method described above. The syntax is basically the same. The only difference is,
that a colon (':') followed by a parameter type can optionally be added after a parameter name like for example
`<amount:integer>`. Parameters that do not have a type specified, are implicitly of type `string`. If a colon is needed
within the actual parameter name, a type has to be specified explicitly, as invalid parameter types are not allowed and
will trigger an error at runtime.

The parameter types can be freely defined by supplying [parameter converters](#customizing-parameter-converters) to
define new types or overwrite built-in ones to have a different behavior.

The built-in types currently available are:
* for all message frameworks
  * `decimal` for a floating point number converted to `BigDecimal`
  * `number` or `integer` for a natural number converted to `BigInteger`
  * `string` or `text` for a no-op conversion which can be used if a colon is needed in the parameter name
    or if simply all parameters should have a type specified for consistency
* for Javacord
  * `user_mention` or `userMention` for a mentioned user converted to `User`
  * `role_mention` or `roleMention` for a mentioned role converted to `Role`
  * `channel_mention` or `channelMention` for a mentioned channel converted to `Channel`
* for JDA
  * `user_mention` or `userMention` for a mentioned user converted to `User`
  * `role_mention` or `roleMention` for a mentioned role converted to `Role`
  * `channel_mention` or `channelMention` for a mentioned channel converted to `TextChannel`

To select the typed parameter parser, add the qualifier `@ParameterParser.Typed` to the injected `ParameterParser`.

_**Examples:**_
```java
@ApplicationScoped
@Usage("<text...>")
public class PingCommand implements Command<Message> {
    @Inject
    private ParameterParser parameterParser;

    @Override
    public void execute(CommandContext<? extends Message> commandContext) {
        Message incomingMessage = commandContext.getMessage();

        try {
            parameterParser.parse(commandContext);
        } catch (ParameterParseException ppe) {
            incomingMessage.getChannel()
                    .sendMessage(format("%s: %s", incomingMessage.getAuthor().getDisplayName(), ppe.getMessage()))
                    .exceptionally(ExceptionLogger.get());
            return;
        }

        incomingMessage.getChannel()
                .sendMessage("pong: " + commandContext.getParameterString().orElse(""))
                .exceptionally(ExceptionLogger.get());
    }
}
```

```java
@ApplicationScoped
@Usage("[<user:userMention>] ['exact']")
public class DoCommand implements Command<Message> {
    @Inject
    @Typed
    private ParameterParser parameterParser;

    @Override
    public void execute(CommandContext<? extends Message> commandContext) {
        Parameters<String> parameters;
        try {
            parameters = parameterParser.parse(commandContext);
        } catch (ParameterParseException ppe) {
            Message incomingMessage = commandContext.getMessage();
            incomingMessage.getChannel()
                    .sendMessage(format("%s: %s", incomingMessage.getAuthor().getDisplayName(), ppe.getMessage()))
                    .exceptionally(ExceptionLogger.get());
            return;
        }
        parameters.fixup("user mention", "exact");
        boolean exact = parameters.containsParameter("exact");
        Optional<String> otherUser = parameters.get("user mention");
        // ...
    }
}
```

#### Customizing Parameter Converters

A custom parameter converter can be configured by providing a CDI bean that implements the
[`ParameterConverter`][ParameterConverter JavaDoc] interface. The implementation of the `convert` method
calculates the converted parameter value using the string parameter, parameter type, and command context.
The class also needs to be annotated with one or multiple [`ParameterType`][ParameterType JavaDoc] qualifiers
that define the parameter type aliases for which the annotated parameter converter works. Without such
qualifier the converter will simply never be used. It is an error to have multiple parameter converters with the
same parameter type that can be applied to the same framework message type, and this will produce an error latest
when a parameter with that type is being converted. The only exceptions are the built-in parameter types.
A user-supplied converter with the same parameter type as a built-in converter will be preferred,
but it would still be an error to have multiple such overrides for the same type.

_**Examples:**_
```java
@ApplicationScoped
@ParameterType("strings")
public class StringsConverter implements ParameterConverter<Object, List<String>> {
    @Override
    public List<String> convert(String parameter, String type, CommandContext<?> commandContext) {
        return asList(parameter.split(","));
    }
}
```

#### Customizing the Command Recognition and Resolution Process

The command recognition and resolution process consists of five phases. Actually, these phases can vary, as a command
handler or a command context transformer can fast-forward the process to a later phase to skip unnecessary work, or
some phase can fail the process with a command not found event.

The five phases that are handled are in order:
- Initialization
- Prefix Computation
- Alias and Parameter String Computation
- Command Computation
- Command Execution

For all but the first and last, there is a before and an after sub phase each during which the command context
transformer is called.

If at the end of the initialization phase, or any before / after sub phases, the command is set
in the context, processing is fast forwarded immediately to the command execution phase and all other
inbetween phases and sub phases are skipped.

If at the end of the initialization phase, or any before / after sub phases before the
`BEFORE_COMMAND_COMPUTATION` sub phase, the alias is set in the context, processing is
fast forwarded immediately to the before command computation sub phase and all other inbetween
phases and sub phases are skipped.

If at the end of the initialization phase, or any before / after sub phases before the
`BEFORE_ALIAS_AND_PARAMETER_STRING_COMPUTATION` sub phase, the prefix is set in the context,
processing is fast forwarded immediately to the before alias and parameter string computation
sub phase and all other inbetween phases and sub phases are skipped.

##### Before Prefix Computation Sub Phase

At the start of this sub phase, usually only the message and message content are set.

##### After Prefix Computation Sub Phase

At the start of this sub phase, usually only the message, message content, and prefix are set.

If at the end of this sub phase no fast forward was done and no prefix is set,
a command not found event is being fired and processing stops completely.

##### Before Alias and Parameter String Computation Sub Phase

At the start of this sub phase, usually only the message, message content, and prefix are set.

If at the end of this sub phase no fast forward was done and no prefix is set,
a command not found event is being fired and processing stops completely.

If at the end of this sub phase a prefix is set and it does not match the start of the message content,
the message is ignored and processing stops completely. This is the only way to stop processing cleanly
without getting a command not found event fired. This can also be achieved by fast forwarding to this
phase by setting the prefix in an earlier phase and not doing anything in this phase actually,
or not even registering for it.

##### After Alias and Parameter String Computation Sub Phase

At the start of this phase, usually only the message, message content, prefix, alias,
and parameter string are set.

If at the end of this phase no fast forward was done and no alias is set,
a command not found event is being fired and processing stops completely.

##### Before Command Computation Sub Phase

At the start of this phase, usually only the message, message content, prefix, alias,
and parameter string are set.

If at the end of this phase no fast forward was done and no alias is set,
a command not found event is being fired and processing stops completely.

##### After Command Computation Sub Phase

At the start of this phase, usually the command context is fully populated.

If at the end of this phase no command is set,
a command not found event is being fired and processing stops completely.

##### Hooking into a Sub Phase

For each of the described sub phases, exactly one context transformer that is compatible with the framework message
can be registered. If you need multiple such transformers, then make one distributing transformer that calls the
other transformers in the intended order. You can also register one context transformer for multiple phases.
The `transform` method gets the current phase as argument and can then decide what to do based on that phase parameter.

A command context transformer can be registered by providing a CDI bean that implements the
[`CommandContextTransformer`][CommandContextTransformer JavaDoc] interface. In the implementation of the `transform`
method, given the current phase, you can transform the current command context, or even return a completely new one.
Additionally the bean has to be annotated with at least one [`@InPhase`][@InPhase JavaDoc] qualifier annotation, or it
will simply not be used silently. The transformer will be called for each sub phase that is added with that annotation.

There are also helper classes that can be used as super classes for own command context transformers, for example,
a transformer that returns the mention string for the bot as command prefix if Javacord is used as the underlying
message framework.

_**Warning:**_ The command prefix can technically be configured to be empty, but this means that if the alias and
parameter string computation phase is executed, every message will be checked against a regular expression and that
for every non-matching message a CDI event will be sent. It is better for the performance if a command prefix is set
instead of including it in the aliases directly. Due to this potential performance issue, a warning is logged each
time a message is handled with an empty command prefix. If you do not care and want the warning to vanish,
you have to configure your logging framework to ignore this warning, as it also costs additional performance
and might hide other important log messages. ;-)

Example use-cases for command context transformers are:

- Custom command prefixes depending on some database

- Dynamic commands stored in some database

- Fuzzy-searching for mistyped aliases and their automatic correction (this could also be used for just a
  "did you mean X" response, but for that the command not found events are maybe better suited)

- Having a command that forwards to one command in one channel but to another command in another channel,
  like `!player` that forwards to `!mc:player` in an MC channel but to `!s4:player` in an S4 channel

- Supporting something like `!runas @other-user foo bar baz`, where the transformer will transform that to alias
  `foo` and parameter string `bar baz`, storing the `other-user` as additional data in the command context,
  and then a custom `Restriction` can check whether the message author has the permissions to use `!runas`
  and for example whether the `other-user` would have permissions for the `foo` command and only then
  allow it to proceed

- forwarding to a `!help` command if an unknown command was issued

_**Examples:**_
```java
@ApplicationScoped
@InPhase(BEFORE_PREFIX_COMPUTATION)
public class MyPrefixTransformer implements CommandContextTransformer<Message> {
    @Override
    public <T extends Message> CommandContext<T> transform(CommandContext<T> commandContext, Phase phase) {
        Optional<Server> server = commandContext.getMessage().getServer();
        if (!server.isPresent()) {
            return commandContext.withPrefix("!").build();
        } else if (server.get().getId() == 12345L) {
            return commandContext.withPrefix("bot ").build();
        } else {
            return commandContext.withPrefix(":").build();
        }
    }
}
```

```java
@ApplicationScoped
@InPhase(BEFORE_PREFIX_COMPUTATION)
public class MentionPrefixTransformer extends MentionPrefixTransformerJavacord {
}
```

```java
@ApplicationScoped
@InPhase(AFTER_ALIAS_AND_PARAMETER_STRING_COMPUTATION)
public class MyAliasAndParameterStringTransformer implements CommandContextTransformer<Message> {
    @Override
    public <T extends Message> CommandContext<T> transform(CommandContext<T> commandContext, Phase phase) {
        return (!commandContext.getAlias().isPresent())
               ? commandContext.withAlias("help").build()
               : commandContext;
    }
}
```

#### Storing Additional Data in the Command Context

The `CommandContext` is also a store for arbitrary additional information that you can attach to a command invocation.
You can, for example, attach some information during execution of a command context transformer and then later
evaluate this information in a custom restriction class or in the implementation of the actual command.

The methods regarding additional data all have a generic type argument, as they all return a value, either the current
one or the previous one, depending on the method. This value can be cast to the correct type for you, but be careful
to select the proper type. As this is an unsafe operation, the type has to be chosen wisely. If you, for example, select
`String` as the type and then try to get a `User` object from the returned optional, you will get a `ClassCastException`
at runtime.

The type can be specified explicitly like
```java
commandContext.<User>getAdditionalData("user");
```
or using implicit type inference like with
```java
Optional<User> user = commandContext.getAdditionalData("user");
```

### CDI Events

#### Handling Missing Commands

If a message starts with the configured command prefix, but does not map to an available command, the command handlers
send an async CDI event that you can observe and handle to react accordingly like sending a message that a command was
not found.

_**Example:**_
```java
@ApplicationScoped
public class EventObserver {
    private void commandNotFound(@ObservesAsync CommandNotFoundEventJavacord commandNotFoundEvent) {
        commandNotFoundEvent.getMessage()
                .getChannel()
                .sendMessage(format(
                        "Command %s%s was not found!",
                        commandNotFoundEvent.getPrefix(),
                        commandNotFoundEvent.getUsedAlias()))
                .exceptionally(ExceptionLogger.get());
    }
}
```

#### Handling Disallowed Commands

If a command was found but not allowed by some [restriction rules](#command-restrictions), the command handlers send an
async CDI event that you can observe and handle to react accordingly like sending a message that a command was not
allowed.

_**Example:**_
```java
@ApplicationScoped
public class EventObserver {
    private void commandNotAllowed(@ObservesAsync CommandNotAllowedEventJavacord commandNotAllowedEvent) {
        commandNotAllowedEvent.getMessage()
                .getChannel()
                .sendMessage(format(
                        "Command %s%s was not allowed!",
                        commandNotAllowedEvent.getPrefix(),
                        commandNotAllowedEvent.getUsedAlias()))
                .exceptionally(ExceptionLogger.get());
    }
}
```

### Getting the Library Version Programmatically

You are welcome to mention in some "about" command or similar that you use this library to attract other people to use
it too. If you want to also mention which version you are using, you can use the `getDisplayVersion` method of the
[`Version`][Version JavaDoc] CDI bean by injecting it into your code.

### Supporting other Message Frameworks

If you want to support a message framework that is not natively supported already, you need to provide a CDI bean that
extends the [`CommandHandler`][CommandHandler JavaDoc] class. You are also welcome to contribute back any such
implementation to the library for all users benefit. You should read the JavaDoc of the `CommandHandler` class and have
a look at any of the existing implementations to get started with writing your own implementation. Most of the common
logic should be done in the `CommandHandler` class already and just some framework-dependent things like attaching
message listeners to the underlying framework need to be done in the sub-class.



Version Numbers
---------------

Versioning of this library follows the [Semantic Versioning][Semantic Versioning Website] specification.
But only classes in packages starting with `net.kautler.command.api` are bound to the backwards compatibility
constraints of semantic versioning. All other classes are considered internal and can have breaking changes anytime.
